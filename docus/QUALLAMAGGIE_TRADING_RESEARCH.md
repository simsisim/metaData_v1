## CORE TRADING PHILOSOPHY

### Risk Management
- **Position Risk**: 0.3-0.5% of account per trade (rarely more than 1%)
- **Position Size**: Typically 5-25% of account, most around 10-15%
- **Sizing Factors**: Depends on liquidity and conviction
- **Max Risk**: Never exceeds 1% on any single position

### Time Horizon
- **Typical Hold**: 3-5 days for first 1/3 to 1/2 of position
- **Extended Hold**: Remainder trailed using 10-day or 20-day MA
- **Exit Trigger**: Close below trailing MA = exit remaining shares

### Market Environment Requirements
- **Uptrending Market**: Best environment for breakouts
- **Sideways Market**: Acceptable for selective setups
- **Downtrending Market**: ❌ **DO NOT TRADE** - breakouts fail in downtrends
- **Key Rule**: Market direction is critical for success

## THREE MAIN TRADING SETUPS

### 1. Continuation Patterns (Primary/Bread & Butter)

**Description**: Price consolidations after strong upward moves that lead to continuation breakouts

**Chart Patterns**:

#### A. Flags
- **Characteristics**: Swift price movement followed by tight consolidation
- **Shape**: Steep rally → sideways/slightly downward drift
- **Duration**: Short consolidation period (typically days to 1-2 weeks)
- **Volume**: Decreases during consolidation, expands on breakout
- **Entry**: Break of consolidation high with volume

#### B. Triangles
- **Characteristics**: Tightening price range after steep rally
- **Shape**: Higher lows and lower highs converging to apex
- **Types**: Ascending, descending, symmetrical
- **Duration**: Several days to weeks
- **Entry**: Break of triangle resistance

#### C. Volatility Contraction Patterns (VCPs)
- **Characteristics**: Progressive tightening of price action
- **Key Feature**: Each pullback is shallower than the last
- **Stages**: Typically 3+ consolidation stages
- **Volume**: Dries up dramatically during contraction
- **Entry**: Break of final tight consolidation base
- **Inventor**: Mark Minervini popularized this pattern

#### D. Cup-and-Handle
- **Characteristics**: U-shaped base followed by small pullback
- **Cup**: Round bottom formation (weeks to months)
- **Handle**: Short pullback/consolidation after cup (days to weeks)
- **Entry**: Break of handle high
- **Volume**: Low in handle, surges on breakout

**Common Elements**:
- All occur after significant uptrend
- Consolidation shows decreasing volatility
- Volume contracts during base, expands on breakout
- Price remains above key moving averages during base

### 2. Episodic Pivots (EPs)

**Description**: Fast-moving gap-up breakouts triggered by unexpected news or earnings

**Characteristics**:
- **Catalyst**: Earnings report, news event, unexpected announcement
- **Price Action**: Gap up from consolidation base
- **Speed**: Happens fast, requires quick decision-making
- **Volume**: Massive volume surge on gap
- **Risk**: Higher risk due to speed and volatility

**Key Features**:
- Comes "out of nowhere" - not anticipated
- Strong institutional buying visible
- Often extends 20-50%+ in days/weeks
- Requires very quick entry (opening range)

**Entry Timing**:
- First 5-15 minutes of trading (opening range high)
- Gap must hold and consolidate briefly
- Entry as stock breaks above opening range high

**Risk Factors**:
- News may already be priced in
- Can reverse quickly if gap fails
- Requires tighter stops

### 3. Darvas Boxes

**Description**: Flat bases where stocks oscillate in narrow range before breakout

**Characteristics**:
- **Shape**: Horizontal sideways movement
- **Range**: Tight oscillation between support/resistance
- **Duration**: Days to several weeks
- **Volume**: Contracts significantly during box
- **Formation**: Creates clear "box" on chart

**Key Rules**:
- Upper box boundary = resistance (ceiling)
- Lower box boundary = support (floor)
- Entry: Break above box ceiling with volume
- Stop: Below box floor

**Darvas Original Method**:
- Nicolas Darvas's classic strategy
- Look for new high breakouts from boxes
- Trail stops as new boxes form above
- Stay in trend as long as boxes continue higher

## KEY TECHNICAL INDICATORS

### Moving Averages (Primary Tools)

#### 10-Day Moving Average
- **Use**: Fast-moving stocks, short-term trends
- **Application**: Trail stops for quick momentum trades
- **Signal**: Close below 10-day MA = exit signal for fast movers
- **Best For**: High volatility, rapidly moving stocks

#### 20-Day Moving Average
- **Use**: Intermediate-term trend tracking
- **Application**: Most commonly used trailing stop
- **Signal**: Close below 20-day MA = exit signal
- **Best For**: Standard momentum trades, most setups

#### 50-Day Moving Average
- **Use**: Longer-term holds, stronger trends
- **Application**: Trail stops for extended runners
- **Signal**: Close below 50-day MA = exit for long-term holds
- **Best For**: Strong trending stocks, lower volatility moves

**MA Alignment Rule**:
- **Ideal Setup**: Price > 10-day MA > 20-day MA > 50-day MA
- Shows strong momentum and trend structure
- All MAs rising indicates healthy trend

### Volume Analysis

**Volume Contraction (During Base)**:
- Volume should dry up during consolidation
- Shows selling pressure exhausted
- Indicates tight supply/demand balance
- Low volume = "coiling spring" effect

**Volume Expansion (On Breakout)**:
- Volume must surge 50-100%+ on breakout
- Confirms institutional participation
- Shows strong demand overwhelming supply
- High volume validates breakout legitimacy

### Relative Strength (RS)

**Calculation**: Stock's performance vs broader market/universe

**Qullamaggie's RS Criteria**:
- **Target**: RS ≥ 97 (top 3% of stocks)
- **Timeframes**: 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month lookbacks
- **Requirement**: Must show RS ≥ 97 on at least one timeframe
- **Purpose**: Identifies true momentum leaders

**Why RS Matters**:
- Momentum tends to persist
- Strong stocks get stronger
- Weak stocks stay weak
- Trade leaders, not laggards

### ATR (Average True Range)

**Use**: Volatility and extension measurement

**ATR Relative Strength**:
- Compare stock's ATR to $1B+ universe
- Target: ATR RS ≥ 50 (top 50% volatility)
- Ensures sufficient price movement for profits

**ATR Extension from 50-Day MA**:
- Measures how extended price is from MA
- **Normal**: < 7x ATR extension
- **Warning**: 7-11x ATR extension (⚠️ getting stretched)
- **Danger**: > 11x ATR extension (🔴 very extended, high risk)
- Use to size positions and manage risk

## ENTRY STRATEGY

### Opening Range Breakout Method (Primary)

**Time Windows**:
- **1-minute chart**: Very aggressive, high frequency
- **5-minute chart**: Standard approach, most common
- **60-minute chart**: More conservative, less noise

**Process**:
1. **Identify Setup**: Stock breaking from consolidation/base
2. **Wait for Open**: Monitor first candle formation
3. **Mark Opening Range High**: Note high of first 1m/5m/60m candle
4. **Entry Trigger**: Buy as price breaks above opening range high
5. **Confirmation**: Must be on increased volume

**Why Opening Range Works**:
- Institutions often enter early
- Sets tone for day's direction
- Reduces slippage vs chasing later
- Provides clear stop (below opening range low)

### Alternative Entry: Base Breakout

**Process**:
1. Identify consolidation base (flag, triangle, VCP, etc.)
2. Mark resistance level (top of base)
3. Enter as price clears resistance with volume
4. Stop below base support

---

## EXIT STRATEGY

### Profit-Taking Structure (Two-Tiered)

**First Exit (33-50% of position)**:
- **Timing**: 3-5 days after entry
- **Target**: Quick profits (often 10-30% gain)
- **Purpose**: Lock in guaranteed profit, reduce risk to zero

**Second Exit (50-67% of position)**:
- **Method**: Trail with 10-day or 20-day moving average
- **Exit Signal**: Close below trailing MA
- **Purpose**: Capture extended runs while protecting profits
- **Duration**: Can last days to weeks

**Choosing Trailing MA**:
- **Fast movers/volatile**: Use 10-day MA (tighter stop)
- **Steady trends**: Use 20-day MA (more room to breathe)
- **Strong trends**: Use 50-day MA (maximum potential)

### Stop-Loss Rules

**Initial Stop**:
- Below opening range low (for OR entries)
- Below base support (for base breakouts)
- Risk: 0.3-0.5% of account

**Trailing Stop**:
- Moves up with moving average
- Never moves down
- Exit on close below MA (not intraday)

**Mental Stop (Extended Positions)**:
- For stocks > 7x ATR extension: Consider tighter stops
- For stocks > 11x ATR extension: Consider taking profits or exiting
- Extension = increased reversal risk

- New highs > New lows
- **Action**: Full trading, normal position sizes

**Sideways Market (ACCEPTABLE)**:
- Indices choppy but not falling
- Mixed breadth signals
- Can trade but with caution
- **Action**: Selective trades, reduced size

**Downtrending Market (AVOID)**:
- Indices below 200-day MA
- Making lower highs and lower lows
- Negative breadth
- New lows > New highs
- **Action**: ❌ **DO NOT TRADE** - preserve capital

### Timing Rules

**Best Times to Trade**:
- During confirmed uptrends
- After market follow-through days (FTDs)
- When new highs expanding
- When leading stocks acting well

**Times to Reduce/Stop**:
- After distribution days cluster
- When new lows expanding
- When leading stocks breaking down
- During market correction/downtrend

## POSITION MANAGEMENT

### Position Sizing Rules

**Standard Position**:
- 10-15% of account (most common)
- Adjust based on liquidity
- Adjust based on conviction
- Never exceed 25% in single position

**Risk-Based Sizing**:
- Calculate shares based on stop distance
- Target 0.3-0.5% account risk
- Formula: (Account Size × Risk%) / (Entry - Stop) = Shares

**Concentration Management**:
- Typically holds 5-15 positions
- Concentrates in best ideas (10-25% each)
- Not overly diversified
- Focus on highest conviction setups

### Scaling Strategy

**Entry**:
- Can enter full position at once (if conviction high)
- Or scale in: 50% initial, add 50% on confirmation

**Exit**:
- Always scale out (never all at once)
- First 1/3 to 1/2 at 3-5 days
- Trail remainder with MA

## IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

### For Automated Screening

**Easy to Automate**:
- ✅ Market cap ≥ $1B (simple filter)
- ✅ MA alignment (price vs EMAs/SMAs)
- ✅ Range position calculation
- ✅ ATR calculations
- ✅ Extension measurements (ATR from MA50)

**Moderate to Automate**:
- ⚠️ Relative Strength (requires universe ranking)
- ⚠️ ATR RS (requires universe comparison)
- ⚠️ Volume analysis (need historical context)

**Difficult to Automate**:
- 🔴 Pattern recognition (flags, triangles, VCPs, etc.)
- 🔴 Base quality assessment (tight vs sloppy)
- 🔴 Market context (uptrend/downtrend determination)
- 🔴 Opening range breakout timing (intraday data needed)

### Data Requirements

**Essential**:
- Daily OHLCV data (minimum)
- Market cap data
- Full universe data (for RS calculations)

**Highly Recommended**:

- Sector/industry data (for context)
- Institutional ownership (for confirmation)

### Computational Challenges

**RS Calculation**:
- Requires loading entire universe
- Must rank all stocks for each period
- Memory-intensive (5000+ stocks × 4 periods)
- Should pre-calculate and save

**ATR Universe Ranking**:
- Filter to $1B+ stocks (~1500-2000 stocks)
- Calculate ATR for all
- Rank and percentile
- Can calculate on-demand per timeframe

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Complex algorithms required
- Subject to false positives
- May require machine learning
