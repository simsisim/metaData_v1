Create a file in src that deals with calculating weekly/daily pct change of stocks in my tradingview_universe.csv
Weekly and daily pct change triggers are user input variables, to be given in user_data.csv

Data Management (I think this part was already taken into account in main.py)- pls confirm

    Universe File Import

        Load the main file containing all tickers and their metadata (e.g., ticker, index, market cap, earnings data).

    Historical Data Loading

        For each ticker, read its daily and weekly CSV files (ensure efficient batch loading for 5000 tickers with parallelization or optimized I/O).

Data Processing

    Price Movement Calculation

        For each ticker:

            Calculate weekly percentage change from the weekly CSV.

            Calculate daily percentage change from the daily CSV.

    Filtering Movers

        Identify:

            All tickers with weekly movement above 20% (up or down).

            All tickers with daily movement above 4% (up or down).

        Store results separately for weekly and daily signals.

Results Aggregation

    Merge with Metadata

        For each high-move ticker, attach relevant metadata from the universe file (e.g., index, market cap, earnings info).

    Sorting and Ranking

        Optionally, sort movers by magnitude, market cap, sector, or other metadata fields based on user needs.

Output and Reporting

    Report Generation

        Structure outputs:

            Tabular lists (Tickers, Price Change %, Index, etc.).

            Optionally, visualize or export results to a summary CSV or dashboard.

    User Interface Layer

        Design a selectable or parameterized interface for users to modify thresholds, filter by index, market cap, etc..

Performance and Maintenance

    Parallel or Batch Operations

        Implement code modules for parallel processing across tickers for speed.

    Error Handling and Logging

        Include robust error handling (e.g., missing data, malformed CSVs).

        Log processing steps and issues for later troubleshooting.
