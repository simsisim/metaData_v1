For your multi-period, multi-indicator analysis of top stock leaders, the best visualization approaches combine clarity, comparability, and trend detection. Here’s a breakdown of visualization types suited to your objectives:
Heatmaps

Heatmaps are highly effective for displaying large tables of values like percent changes and indicator levels across multiple periods and stocks. By using color gradients, you can show strength or weakness intuitively in a compact format. They excel at revealing patterns, rotations, and clusters in data across timeframes and indicators. Your final organized table with rows as stocks and columns as percent changes and indicators lends itself naturally to heatmaps for at-a-glance insights.
Bar Charts

Bar charts are great for comparing individual metrics across stocks at a specific time frame (e.g., top 10 performers by monthly return). They visualize magnitude straightforwardly but can become cluttered when too many stocks or periods are compared simultaneously. Use bar charts selectively for snapshot comparisons or ranked top lists.
Line or Area Charts

For tracking a specific stock’s evolution over time—such as its percent changes or indicator values across daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and YTD periods—line or area charts work well. They help reveal consistent trends versus sudden spikes.
Scatter Plots

Scatter plots can visualize relationships between two indicators or between an indicator and returns for your stocks. Including color or size coding can add dimensions like sector or market cap. These are insightful for spotting correlations or clusters.
Radial (Spider) Charts

Radial charts can summarize multiple indicators for a single stock at a glance, plotting them on axes emanating from a center point. Useful for seeing a stock’s profile against its peers, but they don’t scale well for large universes.
Tornado Charts

Tornado charts are mostly used in sensitivity analysis and are less intuitive for tracking multiple indicators across many stocks and periods. They are generally less suited for this use case.
Recommendation Summary
Visualization Type	Best Use Case	Strengths	Considerations
Heatmaps	Multi-stock, multi-period tables with indicators	Compact, intuitive pattern spotting	Can be overwhelming without good color scales
Bar Charts	Ranking top performers in single timeframes	Clear magnitude comparison	Limited multi-period utility
Line/Area Charts	Tracking a stock’s indicator or price changes over periods	Showing trends over time	Requires a focused number of stocks
Scatter Plots	Relationships/correlations between variables	Visualizing correlations	Limited to two variables (plus optional encodings)
Radial Charts	Visualization of multiple indicators for a single stock	Quick profile comparison	Not scalable for large datasets
Tornado Charts	Sensitivity analysis, scenario comparison	Focused single-metric comparison	Not ideal for broad multi-period/time analysis

For your system, I would prioritize a heatmap for the broad view of all stocks across all periods and indicators with clear color coding. Complement this with line charts for a detailed look at individual stock trends over time and bar charts for ranked summaries. Scatter plots can be used for deeper dives into correlations between indicators and returns.

This balanced approach gives an intuitive, scalable way to explore, analyze, and present your multi-dimensional data effectively.
