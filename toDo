he PVB screener now produces output that exactly matches your original TradingView-tested format and saves to the specified
  directory structure.

> PVB screener works with daily and weekly timeframe? If both, does the output file has  different name i.e. 
  PVB_0_20250830_daily.csv, *_weekly.csv? I am getting only 1 file, expected 2. Output located at 
  /home/imagda/_invest2024/python/metaData_v1/results/screeners/pvb

● You're right! The current implementation doesn't distinguish between timeframes in the output filename. Let me check how the
  screener is called and fix this issue.

  Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Investigate PVB timeframe handling in filename generation     
     ☐ Update PVB filename to include timeframe (daily/weekly)
     ☐ Test both daily and weekly PVB outputs generate separate files

● Let me check how the screener is called from the main processing to see if timeframe information is available:

● Search(pattern: "run_screeners.*timeframe", output_mode: "content")

Based on your comprehensive screening and market analysis system, I'd recommend implementing a Portfolio Management & Position
   Sizing Module. Here's why this would be highly valuable:

  🎯 Portfolio Management System

  You currently have excellent signal generation but no systematic way to act on the signals. A portfolio management module
  would bridge this gap:

  Core Components:

  1. Position Sizing Algorithm
    - ATR-based position sizing (1-2% portfolio risk per trade)
    - Market Pulse integration (larger positions when GMI is GREEN)
    - Volatility-adjusted sizing using your RTI screener data
  2. Portfolio Heat Management
    - Track total portfolio risk exposure
    - Sector/industry concentration limits
    - Correlation-based position adjustments
  3. Entry/Exit Rules Engine
    - Systematic entry based on screener combinations
    - Stop-loss management (ATR-based or technical levels)
    - Profit-taking rules (multiple exits, trailing stops)

  Why This Makes Sense:

  - Actionable Results: Transform your excellent screening into actual trading decisions
  - Risk Management: Protect capital with systematic position sizing
  - Performance Tracking: See which screener combinations work best
  - Market Pulse Integration: Adjust position sizes based on market conditions (GMI, FTD/DD signals)

  Alternative High-Value Options:

  1. Backtesting Framework - Test historical performance of your screeners
  2. Real-Time Alert System - Email/SMS notifications when screeners trigger
  3. Sector Rotation Analysis - Enhanced industry/sector momentum tracking

  Which direction interests you most? Portfolio management would make your system immediately actionable, while backtesting
  would validate which signals actually work historically.
  before that; regarding the market_pulse, maybe you can do some charting for the indicators you have created. Or a xlsx file, 
  then once open really give me an overview and i dont need to look into individual files. In the links I have gave you with 
  indicators they are also nice graphs. I give you free hand to design and create a "market pulse" monitoring dashboard. 
  document the subject (save your documentation file) and give me your plan.

radingView's Custom Dashboard Capabilities

    TradingView supports creating multi-chart layouts, enabling the display of several charts side by side (2, 4, or more, depending on the subscription level).

Symbol syncing lets users update all charts simultaneously, offering some workflow efficiency akin to “group linking”.

With watchlists, custom indicators, and script widgets, users can approximate a dashboard experience, though overlays like Net New Highs or breadth are done through built-in or custom indicators on charts instead of separate data panels.
Comparisons & Limitations

    Unlike Deepvue, TradingView does not yet offer multiple pop-out watchlists that can freely float across screens or directly link to specific chart groups, a feature frequently requested by its community.

Custom dashboards in TradingView require arranging separate charts, watchlists, and widgets manually, lacking a true drag-and-drop dashboard creator for integrated sector/ETF lists, breadth panels, or summary tables.

Some traders use third-party solutions or browser extensions to simulate more advanced dashboard layouts, but these lack the seamless modularity of Deepvue’s pre-built market monitor views.
Practical Solution for Premium Users

    With TradingView Premium, it’s possible to create multi-panel screens (charts + watchlists), use custom Pine Script indicators for breadth, and organize assets by sector or theme in separate windows.

    However, true dashboard functionalities such as direct linking between charts and bespoke column watchlists, as shown in the Deepvue tutorial, require workarounds or are not yet natively supported.
