# MMM Submodule Updated Requirements Summary

## ðŸ“Š **Key Column Specifications**

Based on your requirements, the MMM submodule will include these two essential columns in XLY_gap.csv:

### **1. opening_gap**
- **Formula**: `day_(i)[open] - day_(i-1)[close]`
- **Purpose**: Measures the gap between today's opening price and yesterday's closing price
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Positive value**: Gap up (opened higher than previous close)
  - **Negative value**: Gap down (opened lower than previous close)
  - **Zero**: No gap (opened at exact previous close)

### **2. price_without_opening_gap**
- **Formula**: `day(i)[close] - day(i)[open]`
- **Purpose**: Measures intraday price movement excluding the opening gap
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Positive value**: Price closed higher than it opened (intraday gain)
  - **Negative value**: Price closed lower than it opened (intraday loss)
  - **Zero**: Price closed exactly at opening level

## ðŸ“ˆ **Practical Example**

Using real calculation from the example:

```
Day 2 (2024-09-21):
- Previous Close: 150.75
- Today's Open: 151.50
- Today's Close: 151.85

opening_gap = 151.50 - 150.75 = 0.75 (Gap up)
price_without_opening_gap = 151.85 - 151.50 = 0.35 (Intraday gain)

Day 3 (2024-09-22):
- Previous Close: 151.85
- Today's Open: 150.25
- Today's Close: 149.80

opening_gap = 150.25 - 151.85 = -1.60 (Gap down)
price_without_opening_gap = 149.80 - 150.25 = -0.45 (Intraday loss)
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Complete Output File Structure**

**XLY_gap.csv** will contain:

| Column | Description | Formula |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Date | Trading date | Index |
| Open | Opening price | From original data |
| Close | Closing price | From original data |
| High | Day's high | From original data |
| Low | Day's low | From original data |
| Volume | Trading volume | From original data |
| Previous_Close | Yesterday's close | Close.shift(1) |
| **opening_gap** | **Gap at open** | **day_(i)[open] - day_(i-1)[close]** |
| opening_gap_pct | Gap as percentage | (opening_gap / previous_close) * 100 |
| **price_without_opening_gap** | **Intraday movement** | **day(i)[close] - day(i)[open]** |
| price_without_gap_pct | Intraday % movement | (price_without_opening_gap / open) * 100 |
| gap_5MA | 5-day gap moving average | Rolling statistics |
| gap_20MA | 20-day gap moving average | Rolling statistics |
| gap_percentile | Gap percentile ranking | Rolling statistics |

## ðŸŽ¯ **Market Maker Manipulation Analysis**

These columns enable analysis of:

1. **Gap Patterns**: Identify systematic gaps that may indicate market maker activity
2. **Intraday vs Gap Performance**: Separate gap effects from true trading session performance
3. **Gap Fill Analysis**: Track how often gaps get filled during the trading session
4. **Manipulation Detection**: Compare opening gaps with actual intraday trading patterns

## âœ… **Implementation Status**

- âœ… **Gap calculation formulas defined**
- âœ… **Column specifications updated**
- âœ… **Output file format documented**
- âœ… **Working Python example created**
- âœ… **MMM implementation plan updated**

The MMM submodule is now ready for implementation with the correct gap calculation logic as specified.
