# üéØ SOLUTION: Fix Missing EMA Overlay Data

## Problem Identified
The EMA calculation works perfectly and generates correct overlay data, but there's a **data transformation step** that converts the complete DataFrame to a simplified dict, losing all EMA columns.

## Evidence
1. ‚úÖ EMA calculation: `['EMA_ema', 'EMA_price', 'EMA_signals']` - WORKS
2. ‚úÖ Data merging: All EMA columns added to DataFrame - WORKS
3. ‚úÖ Final result: `DataFrame[Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, EMA_ema, EMA_price, EMA_signals]` - WORKS
4. ‚ùå Chart generation receives: `Dict{'price': Series, 'metadata': dict}` - EMA DATA LOST

## Root Cause
Between data processing and chart generation, there's a function that converts:
- Complete DataFrame ‚Üí Simplified Dict
- This conversion only extracts Close price as 'price' and discards EMA columns

## Solution Approach
Since the data processing works correctly, the fix is to ensure the chart generation receives and uses all the EMA columns that were calculated.

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Find and Fix the Conversion Function
- Locate the function that converts DataFrame to {'price', 'metadata'}
- Modify it to preserve EMA columns for bundled format
- Pro: Clean fix at the source
- Con: Hard to locate the exact function

### Option 2: Enhance Chart Generation (RECOMMENDED)
- Modify chart generation to rebuild complete data structure
- When bundled format detected, ensure EMA data is available
- Pro: Direct fix, easier to implement
- Con: Workaround rather than root cause fix

### Option 3: Modify Panel Result Assembly
- Find where panel results get assembled
- Ensure bundled format preserves all DataFrame columns
- Pro: Fixes at assembly level
- Con: Requires finding panel assembly code

## Next Steps
Implement Option 2 by enhancing the chart generation to handle bundled format correctly and ensure all EMA columns are available for plotting.
