Latest conditions:

  Hierarchy (Highest → Lowest):
  1. Launch Pad (overrides all when MAs converge)
  2. Extended stages (4C, 2C) - extreme conditions
  3. Confirmation stages (4B, 2B) - with MA alignment
  4. Trend stages (4A, 2A) - steady movement
  5. Distribution stages (3C, 3B, 3A)
  6. Basing stages (1C, 1B, 1A)
  7. Undefined (rare edge cases)

1. create a stage analysis indicator in tradingview: 
2. you should have a table that says in what condition is the stock and the condition should be displayed
2. color the bar accoriding to the stage: hues of green for the bullish trend stages, and hues of red for bearish stages
4. do you think my conditions are correct? symetric?
5. create an implementation plan

You're absolutely right - let me analyze the exact gaps in our stage
  conditions that create "Transition" states.

  Gap Analysis - What's Missing

  Looking at our 10 stage conditions, here are the exact scenarios that
  fall through the cracks:

  Identified Gaps:

  Gap 1: Between 1A and 2A
  - Condition: Price < EMA10 AND Price > SMA20 AND Price > SMA50
  - Scenario: Price pulled back below short-term momentum (EMA10) but stays
   above intermediate/long-term trend
  - Market meaning: Temporary weakness in a longer-term uptrend

  Gap 2: Between 3A and 4A
  - Condition: Price < EMA10 AND Price < SMA20 AND Price > SMA50 AND 
  ATR/SMA50 > 4%
  - Scenario: Price below short/medium MAs but above long-term, with high
  volatility
  - Market meaning: Volatile distribution phase, not yet confirmed bearish

  Gap 3: ATR Boundary Edge Cases
  - 2A to 2B transition: When ATR is exactly 4.0% and MA alignment isn't
  perfect
  - 4A to 4B transition: When ATR is exactly 4.0% and MA alignment isn't
  perfect
  - Any to Extended: When ATR is exactly 7.0%

  Gap 4: MA Convergence Zones
  - When EMA10 ≈ SMA20 ≈ SMA50 (all within ~0.5% of each other)
  - Price position becomes ambiguous relative to tightly clustered MAs

  Should We Fill These Gaps?

  Arguments FOR leaving gaps:
  - Transition states indicate genuine uncertainty/indecision
  - Markets do have periods that don't fit clean categories
  - Forces traders to wait for clearer signals

  Arguments FOR filling gaps:
  - More complete coverage of all market conditions
  - Easier backtesting and systematic analysis
  - No "unknown" states in live trading

  Proposed Additional Stages (if we wanted complete coverage):

  - 1C: "Pullback" - P < EMA10 AND P ≥ SMA20 AND P ≥ SMA50
  - 3C: "Volatile Distribution" - P ≤ EMA10 AND P ≤ SMA20 AND P ≥ SMA50 AND
   ATR > 4%
  - 0A: "Convergence" - When all MAs are within 1% of each other

  What do you think? Should we keep the gaps as "transition/uncertainty" 
  states, or add stages to cover these missing scenarios?
