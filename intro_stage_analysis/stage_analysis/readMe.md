1. create a stage analysis indicator in tradingview: 
2. you should have a table that says in what condition is the stock and the condition should be displayed
2. color the bar accoriding to the stage: hues of green for the bullish trend stages, and hues of red for bearish stages
4. do you think my conditions are correct? symetric?
5. create an implementation plan

Implemented Stage Conditions:

  // Stage 1A - Upward Pivot
  stage_1a = close >= ema10 and close <= sma20 and close <= sma50

  // Stage 1B - Mean Reversion  
  stage_1b = close >= ema10 and close >= sma20 and close <= sma50

  // Stage 2A - Bullish Trend
  stage_2a = close >= ema10 and close >= sma20 and close >= sma50 and 
  atr_ratio <= atr_threshold_low

  // Stage 2B - Breakout Confirmation
  stage_2b = close >= ema10 and close >= sma20 and close >= sma50 and ema10
   > sma20 and sma20 > sma50 and atr_ratio > atr_threshold_low and
  atr_ratio <= atr_threshold_high

  // Stage 2C - Bullish Extended
  stage_2c = close >= ema10 and close >= sma20 and close >= sma50 and
  atr_ratio > atr_threshold_high

  // Stage 3A - Bullish Fade
  stage_3a = close <= ema10 and close <= sma20 and close >= sma50

  // Stage 3B - Fade Confirmation
  stage_3b = close <= ema10 and close <= sma20 and close <= sma50

  // Stage 4A - Bearish Trend
  stage_4a = close <= ema10 and close <= sma20 and close <= sma50 and
  atr_ratio <= atr_threshold_low

  // Stage 4B - Bearish Confirmation
  stage_4b = close <= ema10 and close <= sma20 and close <= sma50 and ema10
   < sma20 and sma20 < sma50 and atr_ratio > atr_threshold_low and 
  atr_ratio <= atr_threshold_high

  // Stage 4C - Bearish Extended
  stage_4c = close <= ema10 and close <= sma20 and close <= sma50 and 
  atr_ratio > atr_threshold_high
  
  
  Gap Analysis - What's Missing

  Looking at our 10 stage conditions, here are the exact scenarios that
  fall through the cracks:

  Identified Gaps:

  Gap 1: Between 1A and 2A
  - Condition: Price < EMA10 AND Price > SMA20 AND Price > SMA50
  - Scenario: Price pulled back below short-term momentum (EMA10) but stays
   above intermediate/long-term trend
  - Market meaning: Temporary weakness in a longer-term uptrend

  Gap 2: Between 3A and 4A
  - Condition: Price < EMA10 AND Price < SMA20 AND Price > SMA50 AND 
  ATR/SMA50 > 4%
  - Scenario: Price below short/medium MAs but above long-term, with high
  volatility
  - Market meaning: Volatile distribution phase, not yet confirmed bearish

  Gap 3: ATR Boundary Edge Cases
  - 2A to 2B transition: When ATR is exactly 4.0% and MA alignment isn't
  perfect
  - 4A to 4B transition: When ATR is exactly 4.0% and MA alignment isn't
  perfect
  - Any to Extended: When ATR is exactly 7.0%

  Gap 4: MA Convergence Zones
  - When EMA10 ≈ SMA20 ≈ SMA50 (all within ~0.5% of each other)
  - Price position becomes ambiguous relative to tightly clustered MAs

  Should We Fill These Gaps?

  Arguments FOR leaving gaps:
  - Transition states indicate genuine uncertainty/indecision
  - Markets do have periods that don't fit clean categories
  - Forces traders to wait for clearer signals

  Arguments FOR filling gaps:
  - More complete coverage of all market conditions
  - Easier backtesting and systematic analysis
  - No "unknown" states in live trading

  Proposed Additional Stages (if we wanted complete coverage):

  - 1C: "Pullback" - P < EMA10 AND P ≥ SMA20 AND P ≥ SMA50
  - 3C: "Volatile Distribution" - P ≤ EMA10 AND P ≤ SMA20 AND P ≥ SMA50 AND
   ATR > 4%
  - 0A: "Convergence" - When all MAs are within 1% of each other

  What do you think? Should we keep the gaps as "transition/uncertainty" 
  states, or add stages to cover these missing scenarios?
